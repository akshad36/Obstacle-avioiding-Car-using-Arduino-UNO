# Obstacle-avioiding-Car-using-Aurdino-UNO

Automatic and Self -driven car is thwe new need in today's life.
many Disadvantages are observed in the new implementation.
The main function of our project is to stop the moving car if any obstacleinterrupts its path of motion.

#PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Obstacle avoidance system provides safety for both mobile robot and obstacles around.
Fuzzy logic control system will be used for simulation of the obstacle avoidance system.  
This would prevent any costing for repair and without increase the cost of maintenance or repair of the mobile robot. 

#COMPONENTS USED:
Aurduino

Arduino module is the heart of this project as this controls the whole system and provides signals as per the conditions received from the sensor regarding the obstacles.

Motor driver has the purpose to control the Dc motors which provide power to wheels of our car model. As per detection of obstacle, the signal to start and stop the running the vehicle is given.

DC motors are used to provide motion to our wheels and make our model move.

Ultrasonic sensor detects if there is any obstacle interrupting the path of vehicle and responds back to the Arduino and then action takes place.

#Advantages:
Used in mobile robot navigation systems
Used for household work like automatic vacuum cleaning
Used in dangerous environments, where human penetration could be fatal.

#Fututre scope n Conclusion:
The hardware project performed as per our expectations, and worked autonomously, that is, after feeding the code.
With new car technology like radars and infrared cameras, the car will be able to detect animals and automatically apply the brakes. 
The self-driving cars must communicate with each other for a smooth operation.
